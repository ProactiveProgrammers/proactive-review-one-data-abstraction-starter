## Technical Review

### Record three Python functions from the following sources that you can correctly write on your own without assistance

You can review the following materials for examples of Python functions:

- course textbooks
- course web site
- course slides
- any course projects, including:
    - source code surveys
    - programming projects
    - engineering efforts

TODO: You must use a fenced code block to record these Python functions

#### Provide the first Python function that you can write on your own without assistance

#### Provide the second Python function that you can write on your own without assistance

#### Provide the third Python function that you can write on your own without assistance

### Using a previously provided function, provide Python code to show how to call it

TODO: You must use a fenced code block to provide the example of a call to a Python function

### Using a previously provided function, modify it to illustrate a defect and then explain why it is wrong

TODO: You must use a fenced code block to provide the example of a defect in a Python function
TODO: You must provide at least one paragraph to explain why the source code is defective

### Using the defective function, provide a function call example that would show it is wrong

TODO: You must use a fenced code block to provide a call to the defective Python function

## Learning Objectives

TODO: Review the learning objectives at [Learning Objectives for Data Abstraction](https://proactiveprogrammers.com/data-abstraction/learning-objectives-data-abstraction/)
and then use the following instructions to complete the next questions.

### Record three learning objectives for which you judge you can demonstrate mastery of the technical skill

#### Restate the first learning objective and then explain how you know that you have mastered it

TODO: Retype the learning objective and then explain why you have mastered the technical skill

#### Restate the second learning objective and then explain how you know that you have mastered it

TODO: Retype the learning objective and then explain why you have mastered the technical skill

#### Restate the third learning objective and then explain how you know that you have mastered it

TODO: Retype the learning objective and then explain why you have mastered the technical skill

### Give a learning objective that connects to covered material but for which you must continue to work

TODO: Retype the learning objective and the explain what work you need to
complete so as to ensure that you can develop a mastery of the stated technical skill
